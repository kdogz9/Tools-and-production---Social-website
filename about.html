            <h1>The Legend of the Pig</h1>
            <div class="story-content">
                <p>It started with a simple question in a lecture hall: <em>"How much chaos can 100 students create?"</em></p>
                <p>Greedy Piggies wasn't just a project; it was a challenge to see if a massive team could coordinate a single, polished vision. We wanted to create a game that captured the frantic, "every-pig-for-themselves" energy of university life.</p>
                <p>Over the course of the semester, our group transformed from 100 individual students into **The Swine Squad**—a full-scale indie studio dedicated to mud, mischief, and multiplayer mayhem.</p>
